    "In this cell, we're installing a number of important Python packages that we'll need throughout this notebook. These packages are all part of the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, and are widely used in machine learning and data science.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **PyTorch** (`torch`): This is the main package we'll be using. PyTorch is a popular machine learning library which provides a wide range of features for building and training neural networks. It has strong GPU acceleration support and is used by many researchers in the field.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Torchvision** (`torchvision`): This package is a part of the PyTorch project. It provides useful utilities for working with image data, including pre-trained models, datasets, and image transformation tools.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **PyTorch Lightning** (`pytorch-lightning`): This is a wrapper around PyTorch that simplifies a lot of the boilerplate code we often find ourselves writing. It structures your PyTorch code in a way that is consistent and makes it easier to do things like distributed training and automatic mixed precision.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **PyTorch Lightning Bolts** (`pytorch-lightning-bolts`): Bolts is an extension of PyTorch Lightning that provides a number of pre-made models, datasets, and other utilities. It's great for getting a quick start with new projects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **NumPy** (`numpy`): This is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a powerful N-dimensional array object and functions for working with these arrays.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Pandas** (`pandas`): This package provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. We'll be using it for data manipulation and analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Matplotlib** (`matplotlib`): This is a plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. We'll use it to create graphs and visualize our data and results.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "8. **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`): This is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. We'll use it for processing and manipulating images.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "9. **Scikit-Learn** (`scikit-learn`): This is a powerful library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "10. **TensorBoardX** (`tensorboardX`): This package lets you use TensorBoard with PyTorch, TensorFlow's visualization toolkit. It's great for visualizing training progress, debugging, and optimizing your models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "11. **TensorBoard** (`tensorboard`): TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation. You can track and visualize metrics such as loss and accuracy, visualize the model graph, view histograms, display images, and much more.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Running the `!pip install` command installs these packages so that they can be imported and used in Python programs. The exclamation point at the beginning of the line is a special Jupyter command that allows us to run command-line instructions from inside a notebook. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",

    "In the next cell, we'll start importing these packages and using them to build our machine learning model."

    "**Defining the Model**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This is the main section where we define our model. In this case, we're using a technique known as **transfer learning**, which is a method where a pre-trained model is adapted for a new, different data problem. Here we use the **ResNet50** model, which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the following sections, we will discuss each part of the `DeepLesionModel` class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`__init__`**: This is the initialization function where we define our model architecture and loss function.\r\n",
    "  - We initialize a pre-trained ResNet50 model.\r\n",
    "  - We replace the last layer (fully connected layer) of ResNet50 to match the number of classes in our problem (`num_classes`). This is because the original ResNet50 was trained on a dataset with 1,000 classes, but we only have 10 classes.\r\n",
    "  - We define our loss function to be cross entropy loss, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.\r\n",
    "  - We also set the learning rate and optimizer type, which will be used in training the model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`forward`**: This function defines the forward pass of the network, which simply calls the forward pass of the ResNet50 model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`training_step`**: This function defines what happens in each step of the training. For each batch, it computes the model's predictions (`logits`), calculates the loss between the predictions and the actual labels (`y`), logs the loss, and returns it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`validation_step`**: This function is similar to `training_step`, but is used during the validation phase. In addition to computing and returning the loss, it also adds each batch's loss to `self.val_losses`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`on_validation_epoch_end`**: This function is called at the end of each validation epoch. It calculates the average validation loss over all batches, logs it, and resets `self.val_losses`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`configure_optimizers`**: This function defines the optimizer that will be used to train the model. It supports both SGD and Adam optimizers.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The overall architecture of our model is based on ResNet50, but adapted to our specific task. It is important to note that deep learning models are highly flexible, and this architecture can be further modified and tuned to better fit the data and the problem at hand.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the context of **deep learning**, ResNet, or Residual Network, is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that was designed to enable hundreds or thousands of convolutional layers. While traditional neural networks would become impossible to train effectively as depth increases, ResNet mitigates this by introducing \"skip\" or \"shortcut\" connections (also known as residual connections) that allow the model to learn an identity function that ensures the higher layer will perform at least as well as the lower layer, and not worse."

This is useful to prevent overfitting. We have set a patience of 3, which means training will stop if the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs. The `mode=\"min\"` argument indicates that improvement is defined as a decrease in the metric value.\r\n",

We are monitoring the validation loss and saving the weights of the model whenever the validation loss reaches a new minimum. We specify a directory to save the checkpoints and a filename template that includes the epoch number and validation loss. The `save_top_k=3` argument means that the best 3 models (with the lowest validation loss) will be saved.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **DeviceStatsMonitor**: This callback logs device (GPU or CPU) usage statistics such as memory and utilization during training. This can be useful to track resource usage, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that the training process is making efficient use of the available hardware.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **LearningRateMonitor**: This callback logs the learning rate for TensorBoard. This is useful if you're using a learning rate scheduler that changes the learning rate during training, as you can see how the learning rate changes and how it correlates with other metrics like loss.\r\n",
