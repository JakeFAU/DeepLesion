In this case, we're using a technique known as **transfer learning**, which is a method where a pre-trained model is adapted for a new, different data problem. Here we use the **ResNet50** model, which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the following sections, we will discuss each part of the `DeepLesionModel` class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`__init__`**: This is the initialization function where we define our model architecture and loss function.\r\n",
    "  - We initialize a pre-trained ResNet50 model.\r\n",
    "  - We replace the last layer (fully connected layer) of ResNet50 to match the number of classes in our problem (`num_classes`). This is because the original ResNet50 was trained on a dataset with 1,000 classes, but we only have 10 classes.\r\n",
    "  - We define our loss function to be cross entropy loss, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.\r\n",
    "  - We also set the learning rate and optimizer type, which will be used in training the model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`forward`**: This function defines the forward pass of the network, which simply calls the forward pass of the ResNet50 model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`training_step`**: This function defines what happens in each step of the training. For each batch, it computes the model's predictions (`logits`), calculates the loss between the predictions and the actual labels (`y`), logs the loss, and returns it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`validation_step`**: This function is similar to `training_step`, but is used during the validation phase. In addition to computing and returning the loss, it also adds each batch's loss to `self.val_losses`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`on_validation_epoch_end`**: This function is called at the end of each validation epoch. It calculates the average validation loss over all batches, logs it, and resets `self.val_losses`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`configure_optimizers`**: This function defines the optimizer that will be used to train the model. It supports both SGD and Adam optimizers.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The overall architecture of our model is based on ResNet50, but adapted to our specific task. It is important to note that deep learning models are highly flexible, and this architecture can be further modified and tuned to better fit the data and the problem at hand.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the context of **deep learning**, ResNet, or Residual Network, is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that was designed to enable hundreds or thousands of convolutional layers. While traditional neural networks would become impossible to train effectively as depth increases, ResNet mitigates this by introducing \"skip\" or \"shortcut\" connections (also known as residual connections) that allow the model to learn an identity function that ensures the higher layer will perform at least as well as the lower layer, and not worse."

This is useful to prevent overfitting. We have set a patience of 3, which means training will stop if the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs. The `mode=\"min\"` argument indicates that improvement is defined as a decrease in the metric value.\r\n",

We are monitoring the validation loss and saving the weights of the model whenever the validation loss reaches a new minimum.

The `save_top_k=3` argument means that the best 3 models (with the lowest validation loss) will be saved.\r\n",
